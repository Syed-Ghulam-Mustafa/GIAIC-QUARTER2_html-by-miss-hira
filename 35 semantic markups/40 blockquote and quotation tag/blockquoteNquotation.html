        <p><blockquote cite = https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/islam>
            Knock, And He'll open the door
            Vanish, And He'll make you shine like the sun
            Fall, And He'll raise you to the heavens
            Become nothing, And He'll turn you into everything.
            â€• Jalal Ad-Din Rumi
